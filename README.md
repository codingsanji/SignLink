# SignLink 🖐️🔗
SignLink is an undergraduate honors project that focuses on bridging communication gaps between sign-language users and non-signers by translating sign language gestures into real-time text and speech using wearable sensors and machine learning.

The system adopts a multimodal approach, combining **surface electromyography (sEMG)** and **inertial measurement unit (IMU)** data from a wearable forearm or wrist device processed through a mobile application that enables real-time conversion of sign gestures into readable text and audible speech, improving accessibility and inclusive communication.

##  System Concept
SignLink follows a hybrid sensing and AI pipeline:

1. **Wearable Data Acquisition**
   * sEMG sensors capture neuromuscular activity
   * IMU sensors track hand and wrist motion
   * Optional EEG module provides cognitive or emotional context

2. **Signal Processing & Machine Learning**
   * Filtering, windowing, normalization, and feature extraction
   * Gesture recognition using classical ML and deep learning models
   * Sequence-to-sentence translation for meaningful outputs

3. **Mobile Application**
   * Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity
   * Live translation display
   * Text-to-speech (TTS) output
   * User calibration and accessibility-focused UI

## UX & Human-Centred Design

The mobile application is designed using a **user-centred design approach**, guided by:
* Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics
* Human–Technology Interaction (HTI) principles
* Accessibility and inclusivity considerations

Design development progressed through:
* Paper prototypes (low fidelity)
* Digital wireframes
* Medium-fidelity UI designs (Figma)

## Technologies & Tools
* **Wearable Communication**: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
* **Sensors**: sEMG, IMU (optional EEG)
* **Design & Prototyping**: Figma
